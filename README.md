# AKS-MATLAB

Original AKS algorithm implementation in MATLAB

The AKS primality test (also known as Agrawal–Kayal–Saxena primality test and cyclotomic AKS test) is a deterministic primality-proving algorithm created and published by Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal, and Nitin Saxena, computer scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, on August 6, 2002, in a paper titled "PRIMES is in P".
The algorithm determines whether a number is prime or composite within polynomial time. The asymptotic time complexity of the algorithm is O?((log2(n))^15/2).
